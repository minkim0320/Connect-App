# Connect-App
Full stack web applicatoin where students post about projects/teams/interests, and connect with other students based on the post information.
Features to be implemented soon: Live chat between users, and authentication.

## Tech Stack
The frontend uses AngularJS and Bootstrap to create a responsive user interface.
The backend uses Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB Atlas.

## To run on dev environment: 
Before trying to run, you will need to set up a MongoDB cluster and input the link into config/keys_dev.js. By contact, the link can also be provided by me.
To run, cd into server directory (cd projectpath/server) and run "npm install" (requires node package manager). Then, run the command "run npm dev" and the application will run at http://localhost:3000. (The App is still in development stages).
